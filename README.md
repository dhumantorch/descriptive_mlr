# Descriptive Multiple Linear Regression
This project analyzes Salary data in conjunction with a variety of demographic variables such as Country, Age, Years of Experience, and Education Level.  I didn't truly make inference to the population with this dataset,
because the collection details weren't made clear where it was posted*, but I carefully checked for each of the assumptions of Multiple Linear Regression.  This analysis serves as a good how-to in terms of exploring the data,
both graphically and numerically, and checking the assumptions to ensure validity of any inference that you might wish to do.

# Setup
You can read the .md file to just examine the presentation, or you can download R, download RStudio, then download my .rmd file and open it with RStudio.  Or just look at the .rmd file and see how short my code falls
from production standards. ;)

You'll want to download the dataset, Salary_Data_Based_country_and_race.csv, and once inside RStudio, navigate to the folder that the .csv file is in.  <- To do this, within RStudio, on the right, click the "Files" button,
then navigate to the proper directory, then click "More" and click "Set As Working Directory." Then, you can run each cell.  To run a cell in RStudio,
simply highlight the code wrapped in ```{r} code cell is here ``` and press CTRL+Enter.
